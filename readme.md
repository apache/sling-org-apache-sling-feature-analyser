# Feature Model Analyser

The Analyser can analyse features for completeness and correctness. The analyser is pluggable and can perform custom checks.

## Running the Analyser as a Maven Plugin

The Analyser can also be run as part of a Maven build via the [slingfeature-maven-plugin](https://github.com/apache/sling-slingfeature-maven-plugin)

## Running the Analyser from the Commandlien

The analyser can be run from the commandline by running the following main class:

```bash
java org.apache.sling.feature.analyser.main.Main
```

# Analyser Tasks

Below is a list of built-in analysers. Additional analysers in relation to Feature Model API Regions can be found here: [org-apache-sling-feature-extension-apiregions](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-feature-extension-apiregions)

For further documentation see: [Feature Model](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-feature/blob/master/readme.md)

## `apis-jar`

This analyser task validates the metadata in the feature model for the `apis-jar` goal of the [slingfeature-maven-plugin](https://github.com/apache/sling-slingfeature-maven-plugin).

## `bundle-connect`

Checks whether the feature is ready for [OSGi connect](http://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.connect.html). Bundle with embedded jars are not allowed and packages between bundles must not overlap.

## `bundle-content`

Gives a warning if a bundle contains initial content specified with `Sling-Initial-Content`.

## `bundle-nativecode`

Checks for native code instructions in bundles and errors if found.

## `bundle-packages`

Checks bundle import/export package statements for completeness. Does _not_ take API Regions into account. An expanded variant of this analyser is available in [org-apache-sling-feature-extension-apiregions](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-feature-extension-apiregions) under the name `api-regions-exportsimports`.

## `bundle-resources`

Gives a warning if a bundle contains resources specified with `Sling-Bundle-Resources`.

## `bundle-unversioned-packages`

Checks bundle import/export package statements for missing version information.

## `check-unused-bundles`

Checks for unused bundles, bundles with exports which are not imported.

## `compare-features`

Compares the artifacts in the bundles sections or in an extension between two feature models.

This analyser requires additional configuration:

 Configuration key | Allowed values | Description
 ----- | ----- | -----
`compare-type` | `ARTIFACTS` | The types of entities being compared. Currently only artifacts can be compared.
`compare-with` | Maven ID, e.g. `mygroup:myart:1.2.3` | The _golden_ feature to compare the features selected for the analyser with.
`compare-extension` | extension name | If this configuration is absent, the feature's bundles are compared. Otherwise the extensions with the specified name are compared. These extensions must be of type `ARTIFACTS`.
`compare-mode` | `SAME` or `DIFFERENT` | Whether the sections must be the same or must be different. Defaults to `SAME`.
`compare-metadata` | `true` or `false` | Whether to include the artifact metadata in the comparison. Defaults to `false`.

## `content-packages-dependencies`

Checks the dependencies between content packages.

## `content-packages-installables`

Checks that content packages do not contain installables for the OSGi installer like bundles or configurations.

## `content-packages-paths`

This analyser checks for allowed and denied paths inside content packages. This analyser requires additional configuration:

 Configuration key | Allowed values | Description
 ----- | ----- | -----
`includes` | Content paths | A comma separated list of content paths. If this is specified all content in the content package must match at least one of these.
`excludes` | Content paths | A comma separated list of content paths. If this is specified all content in the content package must not match any of these - except it matches an include.

## `content-packages-validation`

Runs the default [filevault validators](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/validation.html) on the content packages.

 Configuration key | Allowed values | Description
 ----------------- | -------------- | -----
`enabled-validators`     | validator ids  | A comma separated list of validator-ids to enable
`max-report-level`       | severity level | Maximum severity level to report. (INFO, WARN, ERROR) defaults to WARN. Higher level messages will be downgraded to the sepcified level. The default will never break a build.

## `duplicate-symbolic-names`

Checks if there are duplicates of symbolic names for bundles.

## `feature-id`

This analyser checks that the feature id matches one of the given accepted feature ids. If it doesn't it will emit an error.

This analyser requires additional configuration:

 Configuration key | Allowed values | Description
 ----- | ----- | -----
`accepted-feature-ids` | comma-separated list of Maven IDs | The Maven ID/coordinates have the format `groupId:artifactId[:packaging[:classifier]]:version`. Each item is either a string which must be equal to the according item of the feature id, or a `*` which acts as wildcard (i.e. everything matches).

## `repoinit`

Checks the syntax of all repoinit sections.

## `requirements-capabilities`

Checks bundle requirements/capabilities for consistency and completeness.
